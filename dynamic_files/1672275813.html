<p>Causes of Russian economic crisis</p>
<p><strong>Oil dependent economy</strong>. The Russian economy has
done well in recent years from high oil and gas prices. This has
led to strong export revenues and government tax revenues. In 2012,
the oil and gas sector accounted for 52% of federal tax funds and
70% of exports But, the near 50% in oil prices have caused the
economy to suffer. Unfortunately, the strength of the oil industry
has meant alternative manufacturing industries remain undeveloped –
and unable to benefit from more competitive export prices. The
Russian oil economy is an example of the Dutch disease.</p>
<p><strong>Falling oil prices.</strong> The oil price has collapsed
from $115 a barrel in June 2014 to just above $60 in Dec 2014.
Falling oil prices have caused a big fall in export revenue, a fall
in real GDP and a fall in government tax revenues.</p>
<p><strong>Economic sanctions.</strong> Sanctions imposed by the EU
and US since the issues around the Ukraine have damaged the ability
of some Russian firms to raise finance. On their own, the sanctions
are quite limited in effect, but combined with the timing, they are
a big blow to confidence in the Russian economy.</p>
<p>One major issue brought about by the financial crisis was the
devaluation of the ruble. The Russian ruble had operated with a
currency band since 1997. This was instituted as part of agreements
with international organizations like the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, who provided the massive international
loans Russia needed as its economy imploded. As part of the
agreements, Russia agreed to use the money lent to it, in part, to
support its currency. Russia earned rubles but would have to repay
in currencies like the US dollar or euro, so a stable exchange rate
gave the lenders more assurance that Russia would be able to repay
the loans it was given.</p>
<p>The Russian state maintained the band even after it had paid
back its loans as Russian corporations also had international
loans, and their ability to repay was contingent on a steady
exchange rate. Over time, the difference between the real value of
the ruble and the official value rose to nearly 100%, with the
official rate at around 30 rubles to the dollar. Speculators did
not move en masse on this information as Russia automatically
bought or sold large amounts of currency with its oil wealth to
keep the ruble in the band.</p>
<p>As economic pressures built in 2014, however, it became
increasingly expensive to maintain the ruble’s worth and
speculators increasingly applied more pressure, assuming that
Russia would soon not be able to keep up. Indeed, voices with the
government that had long argued against maintaining the band
eventually won out and Russia allowed the ruble to “float” to its
real market value.</p>
<p>Events came to a head on December 16, 2014, known as “Black
Tuesday,” as the ruble suddenly plummeted. Sanctions and the
falling price of oil, in combination with high demand for foreign
currencies ahead of a large repayment of foreign-held debt, all
contributed to the ruble’s sudden loss in value. The currency hit
nearly 100 rubles to the dollar in the day’s trading.</p>
<p>Immediately after the crisis broke out, the Central Bank of the
Russian Federation and the Russian government took steps to bring
the situation back under control. Interest rates were increased to
17% and a major refinancing program was announced for major
businesses with foreign loans. Furthermore, some restrictions on
bank lending (such as reserve requirements) were relaxed and the
amount of the reserve fund that could be tapped into was increased
from about 500 million rubles to 3.5 trillion rubles. The
government also tried and largely succeeded in convincing firms to
sell foreign currencies that they held. This helped to prevent a
run on the bank deposits and to assuage the fears felt by large
players within the business community. Ruble rates fell almost as
quickly as they had risen, stabilizing to the expected 50-60 per
dollar range by the end of December.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Government Reserves</strong></p>
<p>Strategically, the free float of the ruble was perhaps the most
important decision made in creating the conditions for Russia to
emerge quickly from its crisis. The fact that oil had rapidly lost
nearly half its value caused part of the crisis. However, by
allowing the ruble to float to its natural value, the Russian
government was able to effectively double the number of rubles it
was getting per barrel of oil. Inflation obviously ate into this
windfall, but not enough to prevent the move from effectively
stabilizing Russia’s income.</p>
<p>Russia also began to rapidly reform its budget expenditures,
having seen what rapid moves in oil can do to its stability. From
2014 to 2018, through cuts and efficiency measures, Russia brought
down its “breakeven point” from $98 per barrel of oil to just $54.
Although it has disbanded its “rainy day fund,” which largely dried
up during the crisis, Russia now puts any extra money earned beyond
its budgetary needs into foreign currency and gold reserves. With
rising oil prices, Russia’s reserves have recovered to nearly $460
billion and rising.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Russia’s current account trade balance remains
positive and Russia’s budget is still in the black. Given all this,
despite the prospect of additional sanctions, most international
ratings groups are now putting Russia’s credit ratings on positive
trajectories.</p>
<p>Post-Communist Russia’s integration in the global financial
markets was closely interrelated to a particular design of
macroeconomic policy that framed the financialisation of the
Russian economy. For a broad definition of financialisation, we
follow Krippner (2011, p. 27), who explains it as the increased
importance of financial activities and markets as a source of
profits in the economy at the expense of such activities as trade
and commodity production. Gabor (2012b, 2014a) puts forward the
crucial role played by IFIs during the transformation of monetary
policy and banking in transition economies in the early 1990s. The
then policy choices would define the systemic fragility of the EMDs
in CEE throughout the post-Communist period. Based on ideas of
disequilibrium and chronic shortage schools as part of the
‘Sovietology’ and ‘transitology’ theoretical debates, IFIs drew on
the narratives of monetary overhang, excess demand and soft budget
constraints as the main obstacles to a transition from a planned to
a market economy. Excess demand was perceived as one of the main
threats to stabilisation and restructuring policy during
transition; it had to be addressed by a tight monetary policy
pursued by post-Communist central banks. The elimination of ‘bad
loan’ practices as part of relational banking (Boot 2000) inherited
from the Communist monetary system would provide market discipline
for state-owned enterprises. Instead of exploiting soft budget
constraints, as envisioned by Kornai (1980), these enterprises
would rely on the restructuring of self-finance or at that time
non-existent capital markets (McKinnon 1991).</p>
<p>The practical implementation of these theoretical propositions
enacted through IMF conditionality negatively impacted most CEE
countries’ macroeconomic development. For the financial system, the
long-term consequence was an erosion of relational banking that
connected former state-owned enterprises and banks, a subsequent
credit and liquidity squeeze, and the systemic inability of
domestic, private-owned banks to supply productive sectors with
capital. In the 1990s, the interest rate provided by financial
institutions became prohibitively high for most NFCs and consumers.
Instead, commercial banks profited from speculation in financial
markets. From the late 1990s, foreign banks took over control of
domestic banking systems in most CEE countries and thus became the
main credit providers for households and enterprises. International
capital markets became the main source of funding, resulting in
substantial systemic risks connected to cross-border capital flows.
CEE countries were regularly hit by currency crises, followed by
periods of temporary economic recovery with speculative booms in
real estate as well as in consumer and capital markets. The foreign
takeover completed the process of the financialisation of CEE
banking sectors, a shift from lending activity for production to
speculative financial practices (Gabor 2013). During the entire
post-Communist period, national central banks presided over this
transformation. The international central banking community (ICBC),
including IFIs, spent unprecedented large financial and
organisational resources to turn the staff of EMD central banks
into supporters of the prevailing epistemological policy paradigm
of price stability, central bank independence, and openness to
international financial markets (Johnson 2017).</p>
<p>The pattern of the Russian financial sector’s transformation
differed in a number of respects from the CEE experience. The CBR’s
convergence into the policy paradigm promoted by IFIs and the ICBC
was delayed until the mid-1990s. In 1992, during the critical
moment of the transition, the CBR contested IMF conditionality by
expanding credit to state-owned enterprises in an attempt to save
the economic activity inherited from the planned economy. Yet the
great economic uncertainty caused by the liberalisation of prices
and trade flows, with the ensuing hyperinflation, extreme foreign
exchange rate volatility, and unsuccessful privatisation, made most
large former Soviet enterprises incapable of paying off credits,
thus making crediting unprofitable for banks. Throughout the 1990s,
the barter economy, with alternative non-monetary means of payment,
flourished, compensating for the broken ties between banks and NFCs
(Woodruff 1999). The mid-1990s became a turning point when the old
relational banking disappeared as a common practice (Johnson 2000,
pp. 98–108).</p>
<p>The financialisation of banking, alongside the deep economic
downturn, the hyperinflation-induced loss of household savings, the
dollarisation of the financial system, and large-scale
deindustrialisation, resulted in the Russian economy’s low
financial depth. This is defined as the financial sector’s ability
to provide funds to the government and the private sector (Mirkin
et al. 2013). This phenomenon persisted throughout the 1990s, 2000s
and 2010s, reflecting a broken monetary transmission mechanism, a
systemic inability to transform banking liquidity into credits with
low interest rates. The same pattern appeared throughout the
post-Soviet period. Whenever the banking sector received
‘excessive’ money injections from the Russian monetary authorities,
accessed liquidity through inflows of foreign portfolio investments
or by making loans in international markets, the banks retained
financial sector liquidity, redirecting it to speculative
activities in financial markets or currency arbitrage. This could
be observed on 11 October 1994 (the ‘Black Tuesday’ currency
crisis; see Johnson 2000, p. 134), was repeated during the state
debt (GKO) market rally in 1995–98 (Vavilov 2010, pp. 79–82), and
reappeared as part of the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Section
6 demonstrates how this pattern rematerialised before and during
the 2014–15 currency crisis.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 1990s, the Russian state gradually regained
ownership of and managerial control over the largest commercial
banks and financial flows (Viktorov and Abramov 2016). From the
2000s, a new pattern of relational banking between large state
banks and state-controlled extractive industries and defence
corporations arose (Vernikov 2014). However, the basic principles
of the macroeconomic policy regime have not been changed ever since
the 1990s, leading to a contradictory outcome; alongside crediting
and deposit-taking activities characteristic of relational banking,
the state-controlled commercial and development banks continued
their speculative practices in the financial markets. In terms of
working as intermediaries of global financial flows into Russia,
the Russian commercial banks, both state- and privately owned,
facilitated the financialisation of banking activity, as foreign
bank subsidiaries did in CEE countries. Private, small and
medium-sized companies fell victim to this policy and had to rely
on alternative forms of capital supply. Figure 6 shows that bank
credits made a limited contribution to investments, while the
retained profits of enterprises and public funds have been the main
sources of capital provision to NFCs.</p>
<p><strong>Recession</strong>. Due to the 50% devaluation in the
Rouble, the price of imported goods has increased, leading to
imported inflation. With inflation running at 9%, consumers are
seeing a fall in real wages. Wages, pensions and benefits are not
keeping up with rising cost of living. This is causing lower
spending. The Central Bank faces a difficult dilemma – because of
the recession it needs to cut interest rates, but the falling
Rouble has caused it to increase interest rates to 17% – to try and
protect the value of the Rouble – but, this will further reduce
spending and lower growth. (See: effect of higher interest rates).
With the oil and gas sector hit, big firms are likely to lay off
workers, due to the fall in demand and revenue. This rise in
unemployment will exacerbate the recession. It’s a tough
combination of factors, which give the government and Central Bank
little room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p><strong>Falling Rouble.</strong> Despite high foreign currency
reserves, the Rouble has fallen in value, suggesting investors have
lost confidence in the Russian Central Bank, the Russian economy
and the Rouble. The problem of the falling confidence in the
Rouble, is that it is encouraging capital flight – where Russians
seek to protect the value of their wealth by transferring it into
other currencies outside Russia. This is a toxic mix – a
self-reinforcing cycle of falling Rouble, causing more people to
give up on the Rouble.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong></p>
<p>the economy is in a downward spiral. The stock market has taken
a huge beating after the Budget was announced, as foreign portfolio
investments (FPIs) have fled. Major sectors are drastically down
and layoffs increasing.<br/>
<br/>
The economy is, perhaps, in a worse shape than when Modi came to
power. Turning all this into a virtuous cycle, and to revive
‘animal spirits’ to reach the goal of a $5 trillion economy, will
require some of the harmful measures in the Budget to be retracted,
and get growth.</p>
<p>First, doles for the poor will certainly help but there is a
limit to how much the government can afford to spend. Thus, our
best bet would be to support SMEs as debt-laden large companies
would be more interested in paring down debts, postponing capex and
cutting jobs to protect their margins and avoid punishment by stock
markets. As of now, in addition to cash flow issues, small
businesses are troubled by increasing compliance burden involving
multiple filings, licensing and reporting requirements, especially
those related to GST. If there is a political will, the government
can substantially reduce regulatory cholesterol that hampers the
prospects of small businesses.</p>
<p>Why should a micro enterprise, with two to three employees, need
to file monthly, quarterly and yearly GST returns in addition to
several others such as TDS and income tax returns? Cutting these
requirements to a bare minimum will not cost any money, and it will
free up a substantial part of government machinery that can be put
to better use. Small exporters, most of whom survive on as low as
3-4% operating margins, are shamelessly being exploited by banks
that extract as much as 2-3% of export earnings as currency
conversion charges. Making RBI’s retail forex trading platform
(opposed by commercial banks) work effectively and allowing the
likes of TransferWise can stop this exploitation.</p>
<p>Second, the government should focus on helping industries that
have strong backward and forward linkages with multiple industries
such as automobile and real estate, and not the processors of
globally over-supplied commodities such as aluminium and steel. The
country’s automobile industry was already struggling due to
excessive regulatory rent seeking and a rush to adopt tighter
emission norms. Corona-induced disruptions will further dampen its
prospects, and in turn those of thousands of component
suppliers.</p>
<p>Thus, the government could consider relaxing the implementation
of BS-VI emission norms for a year in non-metropolitan areas. It
will support struggling automobile manufacturers, component
suppliers and dealers employing millions of workers, without any
monetary or fiscal stimulus. Moreover, automobile demand is highly
elastic so cutting GST on vehicles will increase their sales
without adversely impacting tax collections. So it’s worth a try,
not only for vehicles but other discretionary goods and services in
the top GST brackets.</p>
<p>Third, helping real estate will help dependent industries
starting from cement, steel, electrical appliances to interior
decoration. Thus, substantially reducing circle rates, stamp duty
and registration charges, and helping complete incomplete projects
by government taking them over and selling land parcels of
defaulting builders make sense. The overall tax revenue gains will
fully compensate for the loss from cutting stamp duties and
registration charges.</p>
<p>Fourth, remove all restrictions on e-commerce, even if a
trader’s body like CAIT thinks that Amazon and Flipkart will devour
its members but Big Bazaar, DMart and JioMart won’t. E-commerce
will help keep the growth engine running by supporting all kinds of
manufacturers and yet ensure social distancing needed to fight
corona.</p>
<p>Fifth, address our huge policy distortion pile up on urgent
basis. Thus, the government should put an end to price cap in
medicines and medical devices barring a small list of essential
medicines. Price cap has failed to make masks and sanitisers
cheaper and it hasn’t brought the overall cost of knee and cardiac
surgeries down. The government should also junk the practice of
imposing different import duties on different categories of fibres
to ensure a fibre neutral regime. That will give a big push to
textile industry.</p>
<p>Sixth, it’s time New Delhi got serious about ensuring a
predictable business environment. Unpredictable rules with respect
to investment, trade and taxes, and difficulties in enforcing
contracts continue to deter existing and potential investors.
Similarly, an impartial regulatory regime that doesn’t discriminate
between domestic and foreign investors will be helpful at a time
we’re trying to lure away top global manufacturers to India from
China.</p>
<p>Seventh, better to reverse corporate tax cuts temporarily that
haven’t led to any big bang investment. Instead, cut personal
income tax. Improvement in purchasing power of the poor is no doubt
helpful, but it will mostly support demand for essentials such as
food and clothing. That is needed, but not enough. It’s the
relatively affluent households who drive consumer demand for high
value discretionary items such as consumer durables, education,
health and recreation services, and homes. Unless, they get relief
on direct and indirect taxes they have to pay on their consumption,
it will continue to cap households’ demand and in turn the
country’s GDP growth rate.</p>
<p>Eight, between raising import duties and letting rupee weaken,
we should opt for the latter. Let us welcome 80 rupees to a dollar.
That will check unnecessary imports, support indigenous
manufacturing, and yet will encourage exports</p>
