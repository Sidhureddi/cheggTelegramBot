<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Dictionary</span> is used
to store the translations. English words being key and foreign
language equivalents as values. That would assist in easier
translations by looking up for the English word and returning the
foreign language equivalents.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>LIMITATION</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>The sentence structure obviously varies from language to
language and hence the translation will not be exactly how the
sentence is spoken. To think of a better approach, we can find the
dictionary equivalent and then work on the grammar and sentence
formation part using conditionals.</strong></p>
