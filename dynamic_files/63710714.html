<div class="hidden" id="cg1">As a student of civil engineering you are investigating performance of such retaining walls under different conditions. You are required to calculate the most critical total active and passive thrust on the wall at Thika superhighway/ Eastern Bypass overpass, assuming traffic jam conditions (the traffic on overpass consists mainly of large trucks which transmit a line load of 18 tonnes per axle). Assume the wall is embedded 3 m into the ground; road structure imposes a surcharge load of 16 kN/m2. Further assume that the retained soil is clayey gravel of dry unit weight 20 kN/m3 for which 25 and c 2 kN/m. The surface of the clay is horizontal, and the water table is at mid height of the retaining wall. </div></div>

<p>THE WALL HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND WILL NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT OVER
THE ANALYSIS OF ACTIVE AND PASSIVE EARTH PRESSURE,AS THERE IS NO
SOIL ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL.</p>
<p>IF YOU WILL HAVE ANY DOUBT,YOU CAN COMMENT DOWN BELOW(DONT
UPVOTE OR DOWNVOTE BEFORE ASKING DOUBTS)</p>
