<div class="hidden" id="cg1">Q6: Consider the cogeneration plant shown in the figure. Steam enters the turbine at 7 MPa and 500 C. Some steam is extracted from the turbine at 500 kPa for process healing. The remaining steam continues to expand to 5 kPa, Steam is then condensed at constant pressure and pumped to the boiler pressure of 7 MPa. At times of high demand for process heat, some steam leaving the boiler is throttled to 500 kPa and is routed to the process heater. The extraction fractions are adiusted so that steam leaves the process heater as a saturated liquid at 500 kPa. It is subsequently pumped to 7 MPa. The mass flow rate of steam through the boiler IS 15 kg/s. Disregarding any pressure drons and heat losses in the piping and assuming the turbine and the pump to be isentropic, determine (a) The maximum rate at which process heat can be supplied, (b) The power produced and the utilization factor when no process heat is supplied, and (C) The rate of process heat supply when 10 % of the steam is extracted before it enters the turbine and 70 % of the steam is extracted from the turbine at 500 kPa for process heating.
